# Lune Ruby Backend 

Disclaimer
Please take in consideration that I didn't write Ruby code in my life as most of my experience in Python
(so it took me some time to learn Ruby fast)


# Improvments
- Use `Docker`
- Change `Author`, `Country`, `Filming_location`, `director` to Model instead of string field in Movie Field
